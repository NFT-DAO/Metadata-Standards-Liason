# NFT-DAO Test Strategy

## Scope

**This is post-development testing**. Everything from User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to iterative testing of NFT-DAO processes, procedures and methods. 

## Challenges

The challenge is how to adapt quality and maturity levels to a distributed, autonomous approach. One possible route is to start with a Test Strategy - where all NFT-DAO's processes, procedures and methods are tested in the community.

## The Test Strategy in NFT-DAO roadmap terms  - 

### Short-Term : 

Treat one of the MVP Releases as a User Acceptance Test (UAT) - to achieve a "Defined" maturity level.
Identify Token Risk Areas.
Run Test Cases with Subscribers
Document outputs to demonstrate NFT-DAO can achieve  a "Defined" maturity level.

### Medium-Term : 

NFT-DAO adopts some kind of quality testing method - to achieve a "Integration" maturity level.

### Long-Term : 

NFT-DAO's whole approach is a test lifecycle - to achieve a "Optimization" maturity level.

## Blockchain Test Maturity Model

This is an adaption of KPMG’s Blockchain Maturity Model oriented towards Test Maturity Models.

The challenge is adapting maturity levels to distributed autonomous organisations (DAO). 

## Risk Areas

[Risk Areas](Risks/README.md)

## "Classic" Maturity Levels

### Level 1 – Initial

Ad-hoc testing.

### Level 2 – Defined.

Testing does not start until products are completed, so the aim of testing is to compare products against requirements.

### Level 3 – Integration

Testing is integrated into a quality life cycle,

### Level 4 – Management and measurement

Testing activities take place at all stages of the life cycle.

### Level 5 – Optimization

Testing process itself is tested and improved at each iteration.
