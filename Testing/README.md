# NFT-DAO Test Strategy

## Scope

**This is post-development testing**. Everything from User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to iterative testing of NFT-DAO processes, procedures and methods. 

## Challenges

The challenge is how to adapt quality and maturity levels to a distributed, autonomous approach. One possible route is to start with a Test Strategy - where all NFT-DAO's processes, procedures and methods are tested in the community.
