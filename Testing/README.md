# NFT-DAO Test Strategy

## Scope

**This is post-development testing**. Everything from User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to iterative testing of NFT-DAO processes, procedures and methods. 

## Challenges

The challenge is how to adapt quality and maturity levels to a distributed, autonomous approach. One possible route is to start with a Test Strategy - where all NFT-DAO's processes, procedures and methods are tested in the community.

## The Test Strategy in NFT-DAO roadmap terms  - 

### Short-Term : 

Treat one of the MVP Releases as a User Acceptance Test (UAT) - to achieve a "Defined" maturity level.
Identify Token Risk Areas.
Run Test Cases with Subscribers
Document outputs to demonstrate NFT-DAO can achieve  a "Defined" maturity level.

### Medium-Term : 

NFT-DAO adopts some kind of quality testing method - to achieve a "Integration" maturity level.

### Long-Term : 

NFT-DAO's whole approach is a test lifecycle - to achieve a "Optimization" maturity level.

## Blockchain Test Maturity Model

This is an adaption of KPMGâ€™s Blockchain Maturity Model oriented towards Test Maturity Models.

The challenge is adapting maturity levels to distributed autonomous organisations (DAO).
