# NFT-DAO Test Strategy

## Scope

**This is post-development testing**. Everything from User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to iterative testing of NFT-DAO processes, procedures, and methods. 

## Challenges

The challenge is how to adapt quality and maturity levels to a distributed, autonomous approach. One possible route is to start with a Test Strategy - where all NFT-DAO's processes, procedures and methods are tested in the community.

A PDF of a outline document is at https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON/blob/main/Documents/Testing/NFT-DAO-Test-Stategy.pdf

An overview some things to consider - 

### Preliminaries

- [x] Add a Testing channel to NFT-DAO Slack to get Developer involvement from the outset.
- [ ] QA-DAO assessment of the failures of the OccamFi launch and how it fits into KPMG's Blockchain Risk Model ( https://github.com/Quality-Assurance-DAO/DAO-Open-Source/issues/21 )

### Practicalities

- [ ] Identify what test platforms will available for different MVP launches.
- [ ] Work out how to capture Test Cases for each participant on different platforms/offerings. 
- [ ] Identify what Risk Areas we are most vulnerable to and prioritize their UAT.

### Planning

- [ ] Agree a Test Timetable, with handovers between HOLONs and support in place etc.
- [ ] Market and Communicate the test as an offering in itself "Come and Break our Token" etc. (to incentive involvement).
- [ ] Work out if we can actually tokenise incentives to take part at this stage (e.g. gamify the test).

### Outputs

- [ ] Document the whole thing and present as evidence that NFT-DAO can achieve Maturity level 2.
