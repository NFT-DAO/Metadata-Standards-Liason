# 02 Risk Areas

Possible risk areas NFT-DAO may need to test. (Adapted from KPMG's Blockchain Maturity Model)

## 1. Access and user management

1.1 Management of cryptographic keys.

Transparency of policy etc

1.2 Unauthorized access of participants

How to handle unauthorised or fraudulent access. 
Cardano Registry has a legal team looking at this in their area.

1.3 How to uniquely identify users.

DID to avoid duplicate identities in shared auctions etc.

## 2. Authorization and provisioning management

2.1 Segregation of duties

Due diligence in assigning responsibility to stakeholders in NFT minting.

2.2 Incorrect authorizations

How to handle errors

2.3 Abuse of high privileged or over authorized users.

How to play fairly
 
## 3. Data management

Data confidentiality

Data integrity

Data availability

## 4. Interoperability

Integrating with legacy systems

For example, off-chain, web 3 and GitHub registry

## 5. Scalability and performance

Repeats earlier issues above in 1 and 2 (management of cryptographic keys, unauthorized access of participants and uniquely identifiable users) at scale.

## 6. Change management.

HOLON agreement on handover between tasks by all participants

Standards adoption in each HOLON

GitHub Version control: forking

## 7. Privacy

Append-only data structure (?)

The ‘right to be forgotten’.

GDPR. (European Privacy Legislation)

## 8. Security

Coherence of the consensus mechanism chosen.
